## 🔥 **Lab Highlights**

### **Lab 1: Introduction to MPI & Parallel Computing**

In **Lab 1**, I explored the basics of **MPI** and parallel computing. The tasks included:

- 🧮 **Power Calculation** using MPI.
- 🔢 **Factorial & Fibonacci Calculations** in parallel.
- 📝 **Even/Odd Processes** printing "Hello" for even ranks and "World" for odd.
- 🔢 **Simple Calculator** with parallel operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- 🔠 **Toggling Characters** in a string based on the process rank.
