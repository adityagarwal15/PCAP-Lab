# 🚀 PCAP - Programming in C (6th Semester)

Welcome to my **PCAP (Programming in C)** repository! This repository contains all the lab exercises and projects I completed as part of my **6th Semester** at **[MIT Manipal]**, with a special focus on **parallel programming** and **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**.

Throughout this course, I have learned how to implement parallel algorithms, work with distributed systems, and solve complex computational problems using **C** and **MPI**. This repository is a reflection of my learning journey, where I document and share the solutions I developed for various lab exercises.
