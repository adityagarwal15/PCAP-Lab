## 🔥 **Lab Highlights**

### **Lab 1: Introduction to MPI & Parallel Computing**

In **Lab 1**, I delved into the basics of **MPI** and parallel computing. Key tasks included:

- 🧮 **Power Calculation** using MPI across multiple processes.
- 🔢 **Factorial & Fibonacci Calculations**: Using different processes for calculation.
- 📝 **Even/Odd Processes**: Printing "Hello" for even-ranked processes and "World" for odd-ranked ones.
- 🔢 **Simple Calculator**: Performing parallel operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- 🔠 **Toggling Characters**: Manipulating strings based on the rank of the process (e.g., "HELLO" → "hElLo").
