## 🔥 **Lab Highlights**:

### **Lab 1: Introduction to MPI & Parallel Computing**

In **Lab 1**, I explored the basics of **MPI** and parallel computing. The exercises included:

- 🧮 **Power Calculation**: Using MPI to calculate power (`pow(x, rank)`).
- 🔢 **Factorial & Fibonacci Calculations**: Using different processes to calculate factorial and Fibonacci based on the process rank.
- 📝 **Even/Odd Ranked Processes**: Printing "Hello" for even-ranked processes and "World" for odd-ranked ones.
- 🔢 **Simple Calculator**: Simulating a calculator with different operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in parallel.
- 🔠 **Toggling Characters**: Changing characters in a string based on process rank (e.g., "HELLO" → "hElLo").
