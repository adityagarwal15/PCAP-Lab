# ðŸ”¥ **Lab 1: Introduction to MPI & Parallel Computing**

Welcome to **Lab 1** of the **Parallel Computing and Architecture (PCAP)** course! ðŸš€  
In this lab, I delved into the basics of **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** and parallel computing, focusing on implementing parallel algorithms and leveraging multiple processes for computation.

## ðŸ§® **Lab Tasks**

Here are the key tasks I tackled in this lab:

1. **Power Calculation**: Implemented a parallel program to compute the power of a number (`pow(x, rank)`) across multiple processes.
2. **Factorial & Fibonacci Calculations**: Computed factorial and Fibonacci numbers in parallel, with each process handling a part based on its rank.
3. **Even/Odd Processes**: Designed a system where even-ranked processes print "Hello" and odd-ranked processes print "World".
4. **Simple Calculator**: Built a parallel calculator to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. **Toggling Characters**: Developed a program to toggle characters in a string based on the process rank (e.g., turning "HELLO" into "hElLo").

## ðŸš€ **Learning Objectives**

By completing this lab, I enhanced my skills in:

- **MPI Basics**: Mastering process communication and parallel execution with MPI.
- **Parallel Computing**: Writing parallel algorithms and optimizing them for distributed systems.
- **C Programming**: Sharpening my C programming skills, especially for memory management and performance optimization in parallel contexts.

## ðŸ“‚ **Code Structure**

The following files contain the implementations of the tasks:

- **`q1.c`**: MPI-based implementation for power calculation.
- **`q2.c`**: Code that prints "Hello" for even-ranked processes and "World" for odd-ranked processes.
- **`q3.c`**: Parallel calculator to handle basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **`q4.c`**: Code that toggles characters in a string based on the process rank.
- **`q5.c`**: Parallel computation of factorial and Fibonacci numbers.
